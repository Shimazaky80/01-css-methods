# 01-css-methods

Practicing how to add CSS to an HTML file using all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. You should only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles via the external and internal methods. You should also use keywords for colors (e.g. "blue") instead of using RGB or HEX values.

The properties you need to add to each element are:

- div: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold
- p: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
- button: an orange background and a font size of 18px
